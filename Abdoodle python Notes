SYNTAX:
CAPITALIZATION MATTERS| CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|CAPITALIZATION MATTERS|
Use syntax "+=" to add onto a variable: Example_1 += Example_2
Use hashtag to add comment: #Chicken is superior
print "___" to say something,for varia` es print [insert variable name]
to turn string into arthmitic: int()
to join while using print: print [example] + [example]
how to slice strings:
str = 'yellow'
str[1]     # => 'e'
str[-1]    # => 'w'
str[4:6]   # => 'ow'
str[:4]    # => 'yell'
str[-3:]   # => 'low'
----
Float: 7.
Integer: 7
String:"7"
Numbers will round when dividing unless you use float(example)
use """ to combine multiple strings:
address_string = """136 Whowho Rd
Apt 7
Whosville, WZ 44494"""
use \ when using apostrophies
alwasy count from 0\
example of indexs c = "cats"[0]
to print variables use print str() (this turns arithmetic into string)
Len() gets you the character length of what you type
lower() lower cases all capitalization ex:"Ryan".lower()
upper() Upper case all characters ex: "ryan" .upper()
how to use % in strings:print "Hello %s" % (name)(if you want to use % for a variable use %02d instead of %s)
THE ONLY CASE YOU CAN USE , IS IN THE EXAMPLE: (name, chicken)
to use the letter in a word look at this example: ex_variable[1] = first_letter ( this will use the first letter in a string that ex_variable is = to)
Here is what the syntax of in looks like:
letter in word
How to use ": password = "theycallme\"crazy\"91"

User input:
input() is how to set a user input set to a variable EX:
likes_snakes = input("Do you like snakes? ")
-------

Boolean:
True and False must capitalized(yes, I know i contradict myself dont worry about and I dont care if it was easier to capitalize True and False)
set_to_true = True
set_to_false = False
True examples:
1==1
2!=1
not False == True
not 7 < 0       # True
False examples:
3==5
"7"==7
3!=3
not True == False
not 1 + 1 == 2  # False
--------------
how to use 
and,or,use Ex:(1 + 1 == 2) and(2+2==4)

If statement:
Example: 
if 2 == 4 - 2: 
  print("apple")
if age <= 13:
  print("your not old enough")
 ------------
use ==,<=,>=,<,>
make sure to indent when using if statements and use this :

Else statements:
if weekday:
  print("wake up at 6:30")
elif sunday:
  print("wake up at 9:00")
else:
  print("sleep in")
-----------

Random number generator:
To bring this function into use you must use: import random
After this use this code: Example_number_generator = random.randint(Range minimum, Range Maximum)
---

Lists:
You can use integers and strings in a list
Example: heights = [61, 70, 67, 64,"lists"]
append always you to add thing to your list, ex:
append_example.append('list')
To use strings or variables in list use (list name)[1] Ex:
print(example_list[2])
-------
to remove from list use .remove() Ex: example_list.remove("chicken")
Two-dimensional lists examples:
tic_tac_toe = [
            [["X"],["O"],["X"]], 
            [["O"],["X"],["O"]], 
            [["O"],["O"],["X"]]
]

Python counting starts at 0
To modify a list use Ex: Example[2] = "chicken"
How to access 2d lists:
example_list = [[1,2],[3,4]
---
Accessing_2 = example_list [0] [1]
---
To modify 2d list: class_name_hobbies[0][1] = "Meditation"
---
how to use insert:  store_line.insert(2, "Vikor")#the output will be below
.['Karla', 'Maxium', 'Vikor', 'Martim', 'Isabella']
----
how to use pop: removed_element = cs_topics.pop()
-----
how to use range: my_range = range(2,10)
this will create a range of numbers without having to type it all in one
to skip numbers use: my_range = range(2,10,2), the last number is the number it will skip by
(Yes we are still going on about shitty ass lists that make you want to kill yourself)
I dont know what this is called but useful to know 
def every_three_nums(start):
  return list(range(start,101,3))
print(every_three_nums(91))
---
use len() to find the length of your list
---
Slicing lists: example_list[start:end]
WHEN SLICING LISTS MAKE SURE TO USE :
---
Use .count()to find how much of something there is
---
use sorted() to sort
(Yes we are still going on about shitty ass lists that make you want to kill yourself)

Math import:
Use "import math" to import math functions 

Loops:
for indicates the start of a loop
<temporary variable> helps determine the value of the element
<collection> what is being looped
<action> what the loop while be doing
Loops ex:
for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
  <action>
-------
secondary ex:
ingredients = ["milk", "sugar", "vanilla extract", "dough", "chocolate"]

for ingredient in ingredients:
  print(ingredient)
In this example:
ingredient is the <temporary variable>.
ingredients is our <collection>.
print(ingredient) was the <action> performed on every iteration using the temporary variable of ingredient.
-------------
3rd example:(here the objective is to count how many numbers are divisble by 10)
def divisible_by_ten(nums):
  count = 0
  for numbers in nums:
    if numbers % 10 == 0:
      count += 1
  return count

print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))


using range in loops:
for <temporary variable> in <list of length >:
  print("Learning Loops!")
 ---------------
 secondary ex:
 for temp in range(6):
  print("Learning Loops!")
Would output:
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
Learning Loops!
----

how to keep track of iterations:
for temp in range(6):
  print("Loop is on iteration number " + str(temp + 1))
--------
While loops:
while <conditional statement>:
  <action>
-------
secondary example:
count = 0
while count <= 3:
  # Loop Body
  print(count)
  count += 1
-----

While Loops with lists:
length = len(ingredients)
index = 0
---

Infinite loops:
my_favorite_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 42]
 
for number in my_favorite_numbers:
  my_favorite_numbers.append(1)
----
the fact that a new number is being added every time the loop is turned on will cause this code to go on infintely

Using break in loops:
items_on_sale = ["blue shirt", "striped socks", "knit dress", "red headband", "dinosaur onesie"]
 
print("Checking the sale list!")
 
for item in items_on_sale:
  print(item)
  if item == "knit dress":
    break
 
print("End of search!")
------
the break code stops the loop from going on infinitely

Using continue in loops:
for i in big_number_list:
  if i <= 0:
    continue
  print(i)
----
secondary ex:
ages = [12, 38, 34, 26, 21, 19, 67, 41, 17]
for age in ages:
  if age < 21:
    continue
  print(age)
----------
Continue cause the loop to rest

Nested Loops:
# Loop through each sublist
for team in project_teams:
  # Loop elements in each sublist
  for student in team:
    print(student)
-------
secondary ex:
sales_data = [[12, 17, 22], [2, 10, 3], [5, 12, 13]]

scoops_sold = 0

for location in sales_data:
  print(location)
  for element in location:
    scoops_sold += element
    
print(scoops_sold)
print out: 
[12, 17, 22]
[2, 10, 3]
[5, 12, 13]
96
-----
List changes:
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = []
 
for number in numbers:
  doubled.append(number * 2)
 
print(doubled)
print output: [4, -2, 158, 66, -90]
------
same idea different way of doing it:
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers]
print(doubled)
-----

Conditionals in loops:
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
only_negative_doubled = []
 
for num in numbers:
  if num < 0: 
    only_negative_doubled.append(num * 2)
 
print(only_negative_doubled) 
-----
2nd example:
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
negative_doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers if num < 0]
print(negative_doubled)
---------
3rd example:
numbers = [2, -1, 79, 33, -45]
doubled = [num * 2 if num < 0 else num * 3 for num in numbers ]
print(doubled)
---------
  
Functions:
Defining Functions uses def
an example of a function is:
def function_name():
--------
to call a function use the function_name()

Parameters & Agruements:
def my_function(single_parameter)
to use multiple parameters ex: def my_function(1_parameter,2_parameter,3_parameter) 
Positional arguments: arguments that can be called by their position in the function definition.
calculate_taxi_price(100, 10, 5)
---------

Keyword arguments: arguments that can be called by their name.
calculate_taxi_price(rate=0.5, discount=10, miles_to_travel=100)
------

Default arguments: arguments that are given default values.
calculate_taxi_price(10, 0.5, 20)
---------

Difference between Built-in functions and Defined functions:
built in functions are functions that are built into python an EX.:
destination_name = "Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta"
# Built-in function: len()
length_of_destination = len(destination_name)
# Built-in function: print()
print(length_of_destination)
---------
another example would be the function max() that will select the variable that is largest and vice versa with min()
round() rounds a integer, how to use it: 
rounded_number = round(10.2233,1), the result of this would be round_number 10
--------
to use variables in functions we use the return command:
def deduct_expense(budget,expense):
  return budget-expense (to do multiple returns use a comma after the first retun)
how to redefine variables after a return:
def top_tourist_locations_italy():
  first = "Rome"
  second = "Venice"
  third = "Florence"
  return first, second, third 
# first, second, and third are the variables being changed
most_popular1, most_popular2, most_popular3 = top_tourist_locations_italy()
